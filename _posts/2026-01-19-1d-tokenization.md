### [An Image is Worth 32 Tokens for Reconstruction and Generation (Titok)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.07550)
- Contribution
  - First to propose using 1D tokenization
    - previous work (e.g. CLIP, DINO...) output 1D tokens for classification but yet still capture task specific features
- Method
  - ViT encoder
  - Vector Quantizer
  - ViT decoder
